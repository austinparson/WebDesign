  <blockquote>"When life itself seems lunatic, who
    knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too
    practical is madness. To
    surrender dreams - this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness - and maddest of all: to see life as it is,
    and not as it should be!"
  </blockquote>

    <h3>Part 1, Chapter 26</h3>

    <p>Don Quixote spends this whole chapter stomping around in the woods, utterly devastated. All the while he is
      commending himself to God and writing depressing poetry. Sancho Panza reveals to some gentlemen the extent of his
      own insanity brought about by his master's wild delusions.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="chapter">
    <h3>Part 2, Chapter 12</h3>

    <p>In this chapter we read of Don Quixote and Sancho Panza making camp in the woods for the night. There is a brief
      respite in Don Quixote's madness and a rambling yet heartfelt dialogue between the two takes place that
      exemplifies the strong bond they have.</p>
