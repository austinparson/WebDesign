I learned how useful Bootstrap is in terms of layout, grid systems and spacing utilities. I originally had this notion that it was basically just grabbing someone else's code and using it as your own, but it is actually an extremely powerful tool that makes it super easy to format, design, and build a website with a modern feel to it. I am most proud of creating a website that really does feel like it's modern. I noticed that the most effective way to do this is to have soft borders on everything, a nice font, and a great number of interactive elements with hover effects and animations.

In adding to and refining this website, I would focus on fixing the cropping in my projects gallery, as my figures were cut off around the edges. I would probably make a maximize rule that would enlarge the pictures after clicking on them, but ran out of steam in implementing this. With a future iteration of this site, I would tweak some of the colors of my cards so that everything really popped on the page, and maybe adjust my page titles in terms of position and alignment. It would also be nice to add a contact form.
