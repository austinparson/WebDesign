I liked that Flexbox allows us to easily line elements of our sites up into rows/columns and control spacing. Grid was great for when we wanted to deal with two-dimensional layouts and the intuitive adjustment of layout based on window size is super convenient. Grid and Flexbox will streamline my future work flow by enabling me to worry less about getting everything positioned just right with float and all that nonsense. I prefer Grid over Flexbox so far, because considering two dimensions when designing a site seems like it's more worthwile. But I can imagine that using Flexbox inside of Grid layouts is also super helpful.
