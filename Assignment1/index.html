<h1>Don Quixote</h1>

<h2>by Miguel de Cervantes</h2>

<p>"When life itself seems lunatic, who knows where madness lies? Perhaps to be too practical is madness. To surrender dreams - this may be madness. Too much sanity may be madness - and maddest of all: to see life as it is, and not as it should be!"</p>
